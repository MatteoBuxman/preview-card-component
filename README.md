## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Sass CSS Pre-processor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Integrating Sass! Learning what CSS pre-processors do as well as how to use it in the project was fun and interesting.
- Using Github Pages! I've only learned how to use Heroku and Netlify, and I always wanted to try different hosting sites to find one I would prefer using.

### Continued development

- Responsiveness. I definitely feel like I could improve on how to make optimal layouts for multiple devices using Flexbox.
- Using React. In future projects, I wish to use React from now on.
- Utilizing a CSS framework. I think it'd be interesting to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap and modify it to match the challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - The official documentation for Sass. Very simple and facilitates the learning process of using Sass for projects.
- [Frontend Mentor trusted hosting providers](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe) - This helped me find out different free hosting providers to try out.
- [Using CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) - This site is a great reference for CSS transitions.
